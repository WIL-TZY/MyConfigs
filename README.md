# Linux Configs and Scripts Repository

This is my personal repository for Linux configurations, shell scripts, and various utilities that I use in my day-to-day routine. 

This repository is organized to provide me easy access to scripts, virtual machine configurations, and documentation related to different software and tools I use.

## Repository Structure

### `/`
The root of this repository is reserved for the markdown file, there to assist with each subsequent folder.

### `/scripts`
The `scripts` folder contains a variety of shell scripts and batch files that I find useful for different tasks.

### `/vms`
The `vms` folder hosts configurations for virtual machines, primarily for `QEMU` but eventually for other virtualization software too.

### `/software`
I've organized specific folders for various software, making it easy to find configurations and scripts related to each tool. Some of these folders include:

- **`/software/vim`**: Configurations and scripts related to the Vim text editor.

- **`/software/samba`**: Files related to Samba configuration and usage.

- **`/software/ssh`**: Scripts and configurations for SSH.

## Markdown Files
As mentioned, these markdown files provide additional documentation and explanations for different aspects of the repository and the tools on it.

- **`linux_commands.md`**: A guide to essential Linux commands and shortcuts (because I always forget these).
- **`pi_vm.md`**: Guides specific to setting up Raspberry Pi virtual machines.
